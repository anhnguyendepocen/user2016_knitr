## HTMLwidgets within R Markdown

[htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) is a package to facilitate
the use of JavaScript-based graphics with R. A super nice feature is
that the graphics will be rendered in the appropriate way, according
to where they are called (in browser, within RStudio's plot frame,
within an R Markdown document, or as part of a Shiny app.

Some examples of packages that use htmlwidgets:

- [scatterD3](https://github.com/juba/scatterD3)
- [d3heatmap](https://github.com/rstudio/d3heatmap)
- [leaflet](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
- [networkD3](https://github.com/christophergandrud/networkD3)
- [pairsD3](https://github.com/garthtarr/pairsD3/)
- [qtlcharts](http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts)

The R Markdown document here relies on a bunch of packages from CRAN,
to be installed with `install.packages()`.
