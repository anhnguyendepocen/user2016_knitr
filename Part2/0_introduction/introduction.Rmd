## Output formats

This is the set of instructions that tells `render()` what to do with the Rmd file sent to it. We'll get a feel for how it works by looking at a few examples. 

### HTML vignette

The biggest use case for this is when you are writing a package. The CRAN folks like things to be lightweight.

If you use this, chances are you will use the devtools function `use_vignette()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
use_vignette("fiddly_bits")
```

### Tufte

```{r}
# install.packages("tufte")
```

Provides functions that give html (`tufte_html()`) and pdf (`tufte_handout()`)
